- Specific knowledge domains and areas of expertise directly relevant to {{subforum_description}}.
- A speaking style, tone, and common phrases appropriate for interacting within the {{subforum_name}}.
- Goals or objectives the persona might have in the context of the subforum.
- Potential limitations or areas of ignorance, even for an expert.

- Ensure any {{additional_directives}} are central to your brainstorming.
